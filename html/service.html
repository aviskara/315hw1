                    During the middle of my junior year, I participated in the Code for Good Hackathon hosted by JPMorgan.
                    In the hackathon each team is introduced to multiple non-profits which each have a problem they each
                    would like for us to solve. Our group decided to work with the Humane Society of North Texas which
                    requested us to create a webapp that can pull their data and display it in a nice clean fashion.
                    Throughout the project I worked on the backend using Django. <br>

                    Throughout high school I worked with the red cross as treasurer. During my time there I helped
                    organize fundraisers for habitat for humanity and collection events for providing students in
                    Djibouti with school supplies. <br>
