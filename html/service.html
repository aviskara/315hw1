                During the middle of my junior year, I participated in the Code for Good Hackathon hosted by JPMorgan.
                In the hackathon each team is introduced to multiple non-profits which each have a problem they each
                would like for us to solve. Our group decided to work with the Humane Society of North Texas which
                requested us to create a webapp that can pull their data and display it in a nice clean fashion.
                Throughout the project I worked on the backend using Django. Although this was my first hackathon and I
                was nervous throughout, my team and I were able to pull through and overall win the hackathon.<br>

                Throughout high school I worked with the red cross and helped out with many of their projects. Although
                I have not been with them since then, I would like to begin volunteering with them once school is
                out.<br>
