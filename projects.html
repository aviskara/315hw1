                    This project was part done during my time with AI4ALL. During the second semester of AI4ALL, we were
                    assigned with a mentor and were asked to explore an aspect of AI we were interested in. I have always
                    had a great interest in music, so I decided to explore whether it was possible for a convolutional
                    neural network to detect various distinct aspects of a song such as the genre or the tempo. Based on my
                    initial research, the whole idea in general seemed to be unique and only a few people have explored the
                    idea, so I believed it was worth something to investigate. Using <a href="https://nlml.github.io/neural-networks/detecting-bpm-neural-networks/">
                    this page</a> as a guide, I began my project.<br><br>
                    Before doing anything with the AI, I first had to collect all the training data. In order to make it
                    easy for the AI to tell the difference between genres and tempo, I decided to find 4 genres that were
                    distinct from each other and find 6 songs in three tempos of 120, 125, 130 bpm for each of those genres.
                    As for the genres I decided to use reggae, rap, rock, and electronic music. Although this sounded like a
                    great plan at the time, I quickly learned that as a general rule the tempo and genre are closely
                    correlated as a song's genre tends to limit its tempo and certain tempos are preferred over others. This
                    resulted in some songs in the sample to vary by +-1 bpm but at the time I simply proceeded with it.
                    Another issue was the lack of training data. This was fixed simply by splicing the song into random 6
                    second segments using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/62872679">this code</a> as a basis until I had 
                    around 1000 sound files in total.<br><br>
                    In order to process the images to use in the neural network, I first had to convert all the sound files
                    into an image. As for representing music in a visual way, I decided to use a spectrogram. A spectrogram
                    is essentially a graph telling what frequencies are played at a certain time with time being on the
                    x-axis. Using the <a href="https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html">librosa library</a>, the music 
                    files were easily converted into png files.<br><br>
                    Prior to sending the images into the AI for training data, it was necessary to do some additional image
                    processing to get the best shot for the machine to make the correct connections. One of the key features
                    I noticed at the start were the distinct “L” shapes of the drums that could be seen throughout the
                    different genres. I believed that these distinct shapes were the key to determine the tempo, and with
                    later testing turns out this was correct, so a vertical filter was placed to isolate the vertical lines.
                    In the image silence was represented by blue and sound with red, the blue and green channels from the
                    images were removed to only show necessary data.<br><br>
                    Using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfhTox0AjmQ6tvTgMBZBEXN">this playlist</a> 
                    as a basis, I created my neural network 
                    and trained the model. The results were vastly betterthan expected. I was able to achieve an 80% 
                    validation accuracy in tempo prediction and 94% in genre
                    prediction. Although the tempo prediction was not as accurate, it was expected as I was asking the
                    neural network to understand the concept of time using random lines from an image. Overall, I believe
                    this was a successful project and I have learned a lot about machine learning and would like to work on
                    machine learning projects.<br><br>

                    Currently, I am working on a neural style transfer project following the documentation on the
                    tensorflow website. Shown below are some of the results I was able to produce.
